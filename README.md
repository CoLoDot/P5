# PUR BEURRE

The projet "Pur Beurre" is a software built in order to help french people who are looking for heathier products to use in their everyday life. 

# How does it work ?
This project is based on OPENFOODFACT's API and a MySQL database.

The random user just needs to open the terminal app on his computer and runs the software.
From this point, the software will return to him two options :
      # 1 - Which product do you want to replace ?
      # 2 - Find my substitutes
      
# Installation (to come)

# Details
The software is built for french people.
The language is french.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)
